# Class 14 & 15: Street Fighter Game Project
## Introduction
Classes 14 and 15 marked the culmination of our learning journey as we collaborated on an exciting projectâ€”a Street Fighter game. Our instructor provided a rough version of the game, and our task was to identify and resolve the bugs to enhance the gaming experience. The game involved two players, each with their set of powers, engaging in battles that affected their life points. The goal was to fix the issues, making the game more seamless and enjoyable.

### Street Fighter Game
#### Game Overview
#####  Players: Player 1 (p1) and Player 2 (p2)
#####  Powers: Each player had a set of powers, including punches, kicks, special moves, and blocks.
#####   Life Points: Both players started with 100 life points, which were deducted based on the powers used
#####   Bug Fixes
#####   We encountered and resolved various bugs in the original code to ensure smooth gameplay. Some of the key areas addressed included:


#####  Correcting power index errors.

#####  Ensuring the random selection of powers for Player 2.
#####   Adjusting life point deductions for each power.

#####   Gameplay Loop
The game loop continued until one of the players ran out of life points. The winner was declared based on the remaining life points.
