# Class 12 & 13: Advanced Conditional Statements and Introduction to Loops
## Introduction
Classes 12 and 13 continued our exploration of conditional statements while introducing the concept of loops in Python. We engaged in a variety of programs, checking even-odd numbers, leap years, positivity, and more. Additionally, we ventured into the world of loops, gaining insight into for and while loops.

### Advanced Conditional Statements
We delved into more complex conditional programs, enhancing our problem-solving skills. Examples included checking even or odd numbers, determining leap years, comparing numbers, checking for alphabets and vowels, determining the quadrant of a coordinate, and validating triangles. These programs provided a deeper understanding of conditional logic and its versatile applications.

### Introduction to Loops
We ventured into the realm of loops, essential for automating repetitive tasks in programming. The for loop was introduced, allowing iteration over a sequence of elements. Additionally, we explored the while loop, which repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Understanding loops is crucial for efficient and dynamic program execution.
