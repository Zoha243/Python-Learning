# Class 9: Understanding Assignment Operators, Compound Assignments, and Bitwise Operations
## Introduction
In Class 9, our focus was on comprehensively understanding assignment operators, compound assignments, and bitwise operations in Python programming.

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. The primary assignment operator is the equal sign (=), which assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left. This simple operation forms the basis of variable assignment in Python. Additionally, we explored compound assignment operators, such as +=, -=, *=, and /=, which combine arithmetic operations with assignment for concise coding.

### Compound Assignment Operators
Compound assignment operators provide a shortcut for combining arithmetic operations with assignment. For example, x += 3 is equivalent to x = x + 3. These operators offer a more concise way to update the value of a variable based on its current value.

### Bitwise Operations
Bitwise operations manipulate individual bits of integers. The main bitwise operators include & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), (NOT). These operations are particularly useful for low-level programming or scenarios where precise bit manipulation is necessary.

### Compound Assignment and Bitwise Operations
We explored the combination of compound assignment operators with bitwise operations. This allows for efficient and concise bit manipulation, enabling developers to optimize code and work with individual bits of integers.
