# Class 10 & 11: Exploring If-Else Statements and practicing Previous Topics
### Introduction
Classes 10 and 11 were dedicated to understanding the fundamental concept of conditional statements in Python, primarily focusing on if-else statements. Additionally, we applied our knowledge to solve assignments involving strings, lists, and various concepts covered in previous classes.

### If-Else Statements
We delved into the world of conditional logic with if-else statements. These statements allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions. If a given condition is true, one block of code is executed; otherwise, an alternative block is executed.

### Example:
If we have a variable x representing a numerical value:
If x is greater than 5, we execute one block of code.
Otherwise, we execute a different block of code.

###  Practicing Previous Stuff
We put our learning into practice by applying our knowledge to assignments that involved working with strings, lists, and concepts covered in previous classes. This practical application helped reinforce our understanding and problem-solving skills.
