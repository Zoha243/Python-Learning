# Class 3: String Manipulation and Pattern Printing Using Operators
## Introduction
Welcome to the Class 3 repository, where we dived into the fascinating world of string manipulation and pattern printing in Python. In this class, we explored the versatile nature of strings, understanding them as sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes. This README provides an overview of the topics covered and serves as a guide to the coding examples located in the Class 3 folder.
## Class 3 Topics
### 1. String Basics
We learned that a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (""). Understanding strings as a generic data type, we covered essential concepts such as indexing, concatenation, and printing a string in reverse order.
### 2. String Methods
The Class 3 session introduced us to a plethora of string methods. These include functions for manipulating and extracting information from strings, providing powerful tools for string manipulation in Python.
#### Here are names of 10 common string methods in Python which we have practiced as well.
##### 1:- upper(): Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.
##### 2:- lower(): Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
##### 3:- capitalize(): Capitalizes the first character of a string.
##### 4:- title(): Converts the first character of each word in a string to uppercase.
##### 5:- strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespaces from a string.
##### 6:- find(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
##### 7:- replace(): Replaces a specified substring with another substring in a string.
##### 8:- count(): Returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.
##### 9:- split(): Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
##### 10:- join(): Joins the elements of a list into a single string using a specified delimiter.
### 3. Extracting Substrings
We explored techniques for extracting specific parts of a string using indexing and slicing. This knowledge is crucial for working with large datasets and extracting relevant information.
### 4. Patterns with Strings
Using the * and + operators, we created interesting patterns such as diamonds, hollow squares, and triangles. This exercise not only enhanced our understanding of string manipulation but also showcased the versatility of Python in handling complex patterns.
