# Class 8: Sets and Tuples Exploration
## Introduction
Welcome to Class 8, where we delved into the world of sets and tuples in Python. This README provides an overview of the topics covered and serves as a guide to the coding examples provided in the Class 8 folder.
## Class 8 Topics
### Introduction of Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not allow duplicate values. This characteristic makes sets ideal for tasks that involve testing membership, removing duplicates, and performing mathematical operations such as intersection and union. Sets are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {}.

##### Common set methods include:

##### add(element): Adds a single element to the set.
##### remove(element): Removes a specified element from the set. Raises an error if the element is not present.
##### discard(element): Removes a specified element from the set if it is present, and does nothing if the element is not found.
##### union(other_set): Returns a new set containing all unique elements from both sets.
##### intersection(other_set): Returns a new set containing common elements between two sets.
### Introduction of Tuples
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Tuples are defined using parentheses () and can store a variety of data types. The immutability of tuples means their elements cannot be modified once the tuple is created, providing stability in scenarios where data should remain constant.

##### Common tuple methods include:

##### count(element): Returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple.
##### index(element): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the tuple.
