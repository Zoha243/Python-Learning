# Class 18: Advanced Functions and Calculator Project
### Introduction
Class 18 delved deeper into the realm of functions in Python, with a special focus on the return statement. Understanding how functions can return values is crucial for building more complex and dynamic programs. As part of the practical application, a calculator project was assigned, challenging us to create a calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, factorial, and square root, utilizing only the + and - operators.

### Functions and the Return Statement
### 1. Function Practice
We further practiced defining and calling functions, reinforcing the concepts learned in the previous class. Functions were utilized for modularity and code organization.

### 2. Return Statement
The return statement in functions allows us to send a value back from the function. We explored how to use return to convey results and make functions more versatile.

## Calculator Project
## Task Description
The assignment involved creating a calculator with the following functions:

### Addition: Add two numbers.
### Subtraction: Subtract the second number from the first.
### Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
### Factorial: Calculate the factorial of a number.
### Square Root: Compute the square root of a number.
### Implementation
The calculator project showcased the power of functions, limiting the use of operators to + and -. Each operation was encapsulated within a separate function, enhancing the calculator's modular design.

### Class 18 Folder
Navigate to the Class 18 folder to find the complete code for the calculator project, including individual functions for each operation.
