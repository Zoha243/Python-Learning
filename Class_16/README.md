# Class 16: Exploring For Loops - Pattern Practice
### Introduction
In Class 16, our focus shifted to mastering the for loop in Python. We engaged in extensive practice by working on programs to create various patterns. These patterns included geometric shapes like squares, triangles, diamonds, hollow patterns, and an hourglass. The goal was to reinforce our understanding of for loops and pattern generation, enhancing our problem-solving skills.

### Pattern Programs
#### 1. Square Patterns
We explored different variations of square patterns, including filled and hollow squares.

#### 2. Triangle Patterns
The class covered the creation of various triangle patterns, such as right-angled triangles and equilateral triangles.

#### 3. Diamond Patterns
We delved into the creation of diamond patterns, both filled and hollow, to understand complex pattern generation.

#### 4. Hourglass Pattern
The hourglass pattern, a more intricate design, allowed us to practice nested loops and pattern composition.
