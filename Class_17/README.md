# Class 17: Understanding Functions - Basics and Parameters
## Introduction
## Class 17 focused on the fundamental concept of functions in Python. Functions are essential building blocks in programming, allowing us to encapsulate and reuse code. The class covered the basics of functions, including their introduction, structure, and the concepts of arguments and parameters.

## Functions in Python
### 1. Function Introduction
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It helps in organizing code, making it modular and more readable.

### 2. Function Structure
We explored the structure of a function, including the function name, parameters, and the body of the function. Functions are defined using the def keyword.

### 3. Arguments and Parameters
Understanding the concepts of arguments and parameters is crucial. Parameters are placeholders in the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function during its invocation.

### Class 17 Topics
Defining Functions: Understanding how to define a function with the def keyword.

### Function Parameters: Exploring the use of parameters in function definitions to make them flexible and dynamic.

### Function Invocation: Learning how to call or invoke a function, providing actual values as arguments.

### Class 17 Folder
Navigate to the Class 17 folder to find practical coding examples related to functions and their basics. The examples are organized to help you explore and reinforce the concepts covered in this class.
