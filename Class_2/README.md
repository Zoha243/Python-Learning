# Class 2: Variables, Data Types, and Arithmetic Operators
## Introduction
Welcome to the Class 2 , Here we delve into the fundamental concepts of programming. In this class, we covered essential topics such as Variables, Data Types, and Numerical Data Types. Additionally, we explored the world of Arithmetic Operators, gaining insights into how these operators function within Python. Understanding these concepts is crucial as they form the building blocks for more complex programming tasks.
## Class 2 Topics
### 1. Variables and Data Types
We learned about the concept of variables, which act as containers for storing data values. Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, and strings. The choice of data type depends on the nature of the data we are working with. For instance, integers are used for whole numbers, floats for decimal numbers, and strings for text.
### 2. Numerical Data Types
Numerical data types play a vital role in mathematical operations. We explored how to use integers and floats for numerical calculations. This knowledge is essential for handling quantitative data and performing mathematical operations in our programs.

### 3. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are the tools we use to perform mathematical operations in Python. We covered operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). These operators enable us to manipulate numerical data and are foundational for more complex computations.
