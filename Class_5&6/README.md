# Class 5 & 6: Strengthening Basics - Lists and Advanced String Logic
## Introduction
Classes 5 and 6 focused on strengthening our foundational knowledge by introducing the concept of lists and further practicing advanced string functions. This README provides an overview of the topics covered and serves as a guide to the coding examples provided in the Class 5 & 6 folders.

### Class 5 & 6 Topics
### 1. Introduction to Lists
We embarked on our journey into data structures with an introduction to lists. Lists are versatile and dynamic containers that allow us to store and manipulate collections of items. Understanding the fundamentals of lists lays the groundwork for more complex data structures.

### 2. Advanced String Logic
Building on our previous understanding of strings, we delved into creating more intricate logic using advanced string functions. These exercises aimed to solidify our grasp of string manipulation techniques and enhance problem-solving skills.
