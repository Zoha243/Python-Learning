# Class 7: Exploring Python Dictionaries
## Introduction
Welcome to Class 7, where we explored the fundamental concepts of dictionaries in Python. This README provides an overview of the topics covered and serves as a guide to the coding examples provided in the Class 7 folder.

## Class 7 Topics
### 1. Introduction to Dictionaries
In Class 7, we delved into the versatile world of dictionaries in Python. A dictionary is a powerful data structure that allows us to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs. Unlike lists and tuples, where elements are accessed by their index, dictionaries use unique keys for efficient data retrieval. This data structure is ideal for scenarios where items need to be organized and accessed based on descriptive labels rather than numerical indices. Understanding dictionaries is essential for efficient data manipulation and organization in Python programming.

### 2. Dictionary Methods
We delved into various methods available for dictionaries in Python, such as keys(), values(), and items(). These methods offer ways to extract information about keys, values, and key-value pairs, enabling effective data manipulation.
